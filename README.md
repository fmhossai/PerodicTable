Interactive Perodic Table using Bowserinator's Periodic Table JSON(https://github.com/Bowserinator/Periodic-Table-JSON) to get the elements and their data.

Hosted on Netfliy here(https://interactive-periodic-table.netlify.com)

# Interactivity includes 
A search function, which helps you locate a certain element using thier symbol or name.
Buttons that highlight search group elements, like Alkaline Earth Metals, Alkali Metals, Noble Gases and many more.
Quickly search back and forth between highlighting and non-highlighting elements, so you would know what a basic Perodic Table would look like without hightlighting, useful for studying.
